## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

1. Build a strong foundation in Machine Learning and AI concepts.
2. Learn to implement popular algorithms and models using Python and libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
3. Explore topics like:
   - Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
   - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
   - Computer Vision and Image Recognition
   - Natural Language Processing
4. Create end-to-end projects to solidify my understanding.
5. Share what I learn to help others who are also on this journey.
